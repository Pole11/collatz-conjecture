# Collatz conjecture

## Info
This is the result of an afternoon I spent with my friends, trying to solve the collatz conjecture. When didn't really know how to proceed, we tried to see the realtion between the number and the number of cycles that it takes to get it to the corresponding number for the conjecture. If you want to know more about the conjecture, you can look at it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) on wikipedia.
